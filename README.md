The Weather App!

Welcome to my Weather App repo, the project for my Mutliverse final project. In this repo you will find the solution file for my Weather (React)App, written in C#.

---------------------------------Fun stuff-------------------------------------------

Project Idea:

	1. Weather App
		a. MVP
  		○ Temp for one or two made-up city reports
  			{ 
  			    Seattle: 
  			        [day1, day2, day3, day4]
  			    Portland:
  				[day1, day2, day3, day4]
  			}
  		○ 7-day forecast cards
  			{
  			    day1: 
  				[High, Low, CurrTemp, [24 (hourly) temps]]
  			    day2:
  				[High, Low, CurrTemp, [24 (hourly) temps]]
  			    ….
  			}
  		○ Fahrenheit and Celsius temps
  			§ F/C on Nav Header
		
		b. Extensions
  		○ Local City Weather for all cities in world
  		○ Cards showcasing hourly, daily, weekly, monthly forecast based on user choice
  			§ Nav Header bar with options for each view
  		○ Temp records for each day and month
  		○ Daily forecast statistics, I.e. rain chance, pollen count, visibility, etc.

---------------------------------How-to Use-------------------------------------------
1. Open the WeathApp.sln
2. Run the Debugger
3. The localhost site will open, the weather is defaulted to Seattle, Wa
4. You can see the current weather or 5-day forecast for any US city by entering it into the search bar (adding a state with the city will give you more accurate data)
